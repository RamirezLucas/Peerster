/*SReqTotalMatch is used to count the number of total matches associated to an emmited
`SearchRequest`. A `SearchRequest` is identified by its list of keywords. Each time a `SearchReply` is
received and triggers a total match, any `SearchRequest` including a keyword that is contained in the
SearchReply's `filename` field will see its number of total matches incremented by 1.

A SReqTotalMatch object should be created by calling `NewSReqTotalMatch()`. Once created, the
object is thread-safe, meaning that several threads may manipulate the object through its API simultaneously.*/
